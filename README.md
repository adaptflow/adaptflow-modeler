# AdaptflowModeler

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.6.

## Problems
1. To test RAG/Agents, we need to write repeativie/boilerplate code which needs technical skills. Non-technical users like Business analysts, operations managers, marketing/sales teams, etc. find it difficult to design and test AI agents. They may use codeless applications for the same.
2. Even after using codeless application to prototype an idea/project, currently there are technical challenges to seamlessly bring such codeless applications into the production.

## Solution
### Phase 1:
Use cases:
1. [UI] BPMN 2.0 based modeler to allow a user to design RAG/Agent as a process and also facilitate execution to test them and it can be chat system.
2. [BACKEND] BPMN 2.0 based execution engine to execute the processes and return the output to UI(chat system)

### Phase 2:
Use cases:
1. Export designed model as standalone java application.
---
### Phase 3:
Use cases:
1. In addition to Java, allow other backends like python to execute BPMN process based RAG/Agent models and export them as standalone application.
